# About

This tool was written because i needed a HUD of personal and work tasks. 

The main skeleton of it was written by ChatGPT. (legitmately) - I used this tool as an exercise also to see how far I could push the free version. It was my software developer, and I was the project mangaer and debug' guy and ideas person.

One day I may share that whole log.

Eventually ChatGPT was rubbish, so it's been hand carved after it became complex.
